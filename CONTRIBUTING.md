### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: There is a general lack of scripts for Windows OS with regards to automation and DevOps.
It would be great to see more contribution in this areas with scripts that automate mundane and routine tasks.
- **qa-needed**: We may not have the environment to test all scripts, your help is needed if you have the following environment to perform QA.
- **documentation-needed**: If any of the comments within scripts are not clear, we will appreciate feedbacks to improve the clarity.
- **bug-high-priority**: Unexpected or unintended results from script executing
- **bug-low-priority**: Either cosmetic in nature, querying the wrong properties, or a more efficient way to query
- **help-wanted**: Any help is appreciated

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
